### Key Analyses Performed (SQL in BigQuery)
- Average charges by **smoker status**
- Charges segmented by **region** and **smoker type**
- **Cross-analysis of age and BMI groups**
- Trend of charges based on number of **children**

The cleaned and aggregated data was exported from BigQuery and used as the data source for Tableau.
