# Healthcare Claims Utilization Analysis (SQL + Tableau)

This project analyzes simulated healthcare claims data to uncover utilization patterns and cost trends across different patient groups, states, diagnoses, and procedures.

## Objective

To simulate how a healthcare analyst or insurance operations team might use SQL and Tableau to:

- Identify high-frequency diagnoses
- Analyze claim volume by gender, age, and state
- Track total claim costs by procedure
- Discover utilization patterns and cost outliers

## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL** (PostgreSQL or BigQuery syntax)
- **Tableau** (for dashboards and visual storytelling)
- **Excel/CSV** (for source data storage)
- **Joins, Group By, Aggregations, Filters**

## Deliverables

- SQL queries with insight-focused logic
- Tableau dashboard (TWBX or screenshots)
- README documentation
- Optional: Python cleaning script (if required)

## Outcome

The final dashboard will simulate a real healthcare operations report and demonstrate my ability to extract insights from patient-level data and present them in a clear, business-friendly way.
