# Capstone Project – Analyst Job Listing Insights via Web Scraping
  
This project was built to analyze job listings across top enterprise companies in Dallas. The goal was to gather live job data from company career portals, understand role requirements, and identify trends in skills, qualifications, and expectations. I designed this workflow using Python and automated scraping techniques to simulate a real-world workforce analytics project.

## Project Overview

I wrote custom Python scripts using Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape job descriptions from four companies — IBM, AT&T, Equinox, and Texas Instruments. Each script was tailored to the structure of the company’s job portal. The data was cleaned and structured into Excel files for further comparison and analysis.

This project gave me hands-on experience in dynamic web scraping, data cleaning, and creating structured outputs for insights.
