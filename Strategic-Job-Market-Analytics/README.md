# Capstone Project – Analyst Job Listing Insights via Web Scraping

This project was built to analyze job listings for analyst roles across top tech companies in Dallas. The goal was to gather live job data from multiple company websites, understand role requirements, and identify trends in skills, qualifications, and expectations. I designed this workflow using Python and automated scraping techniques to simulate a real-world workforce analytics project.

## Project Overview

I wrote custom Python scripts using Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape job descriptions from four companies — IBM, AT&T, Equinox, and Texas Instruments. Each script was tailored to the structure of the company’s job portal. The data was cleaned and structured into Excel files for further comparison and analysis.

This project gave me hands-on experience in dynamic web scraping, data cleaning, and creating structured outputs for insights.

## Objectives
- Collect live job postings for analyst roles across 4 enterprise-level companies
- Extract key fields: job title, location, posted date, responsibilities, qualifications
- Standardize and organize the data for analysis in Excel
- Understand skill demand patterns and common expectations across firms

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Pandas)
- Excel for storing final outputs
- Manual logic handling for DOM parsing
- ChromeDriver for browser automation

## Companies Covered
- **IBM**  
- **AT&T**  
- **Equinox**  
- **Texas Instruments**
