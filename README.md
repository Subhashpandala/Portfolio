# Hi there, Iâ€™m Subhash Chandra Pandala â€” Data Analytics & Engineering Portfolio

Whether you're a recruiter, a fellow data nerd, or just stumbled across this page â€” welcome.

This is where I share the projects that have helped me grow as a data professional. Each one represents a challenge I tackled, a skill I sharpened, or a story I tried to tell with data. From dashboards to pipelines, this portfolio is about building, breaking, and learning â€” always with the goal of turning raw information into something meaningful.

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here

This space is a mix of:
- Finished projects that solve real-world problems
- Work-in-progress experiments
- Hands-on builds across analysis, engineering, and BI

Most projects use tools like **SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau**, and **BigQuery** â€” but more important than the tools is how I think through the problem, the business context, and how I communicate results clearly.
