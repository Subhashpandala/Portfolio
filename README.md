# Hey, I’m Subhash — Welcome to My Data Portfolio

This isn’t just a portfolio — it’s my learning journal, growth tracker, and proof of the work I’m putting in.

I’m learning data the right way: by building real projects, solving real problems, and sharing every step of the journey. I’m following a bootcamp-style roadmap that emphasizes hands-on learning — not just watching videos or collecting certificates, but doing the kind of work I’d actually do on the job.

## Why I'm Doing This

I’m drawn to data because I like making sense of things — spotting patterns, asking better questions, and turning raw information into insights that matter. This portfolio reflects that mindset.

For me, it’s not about showing off tools. It’s about thinking clearly, solving with purpose, and building credibility through consistency.

## What You'll Find Here

You’ll find projects that reflect how I’m learning to think and work like a data professional — across analytics, engineering, and storytelling.

I’m exploring:
- How to ask better questions and design meaningful analyses  
- How to use tools like Excel, SQL, and Python to work with data hands-on  
- How to create dashboards and visuals that simplify complex ideas  
- How to simulate workflows that happen in real jobs, not just tutorials  

Each project is built from scratch, explained in my own words, and meant to show real progress — not perfection.

Feel free to click into any folder, read through the process, and check out the code, dashboards, or analysis. Everything here is something I’ve actually built and understood — and I’m updating this regularly as I learn more.

Thanks for stopping by — and if you ever want to talk data, dashboards, or decision-making, you know where to find me.
