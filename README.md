# Hi there, I'm Subhash Chandra Pandala â€“ Analytics & Engineering Portfolio

Whether you're a recruiter, a fellow data nerd, or just lost in GitHub... you're in the right place.

This portfolio is where I build, break, and showcase projects that reflect how I think, how I solve problems, and how I translate raw data into something humans can actually use. My work blends **business intelligence, healthcare analytics, data engineering, and storytelling** â€“ because I believe dashboards should speak human, not just SQL.
